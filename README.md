## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) based on the download instructions for your specific operating system. You can check for a version of Python on your computer by running
    ```Shell
    $ python -V
    ```
    However, make sure to check the [Tensorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) to ensure that your version will work

* Install Tensorflow using Python's package manager, pip. If your version of pip is out of date, first update it using
    ```Shell
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
    Then, install Tensorflow with
    ```Shell
    $ pip install tensorflow
    ```
